Rocket Seat / Next Level Week 

In this project, I developed a recycle company website for:
- Presenting the nearest collection point based on client's location;
- Registering new collection point;
- Storaging new collection points on data base.

HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used to build front-end while NODE.js was mainly used to developed back-end with JQUERY, Nunjucks, Express and SQL.

You just checked my project! Let me see you and your opinion... It will be great! :)
